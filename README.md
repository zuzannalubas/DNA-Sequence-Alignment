# DNA Sequence Alignment ðŸ§¬  

## ðŸ“Œ Description  
This project implements **sequence alignment algorithms**, including:  
- **Needleman-Wunsch** (global alignment)  
- **Smith-Waterman** (local alignment - coming soon)  

The program aligns two DNA sequences and returns their optimal alignment.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies  
- Python  
- NumPy  

## ðŸš€ Installation & Usage  
### 1. Clone the repository:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DNA-Sequence-Alignment.git  
cd DNA-Sequence-Alignment  
```

## ðŸ“œ Features  
- Implements **Needleman-Wunsch** algorithm for global alignment.  
- Future support for **Smith-Waterman** local alignment.  
- Supports custom DNA sequences.  
- Outputs alignment scores and optimal alignments.
